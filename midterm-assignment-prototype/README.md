Approved Sites provided by college/teachers have no free videos! Only available for purchase, B-rolls are free. That's why I created my own short clip

Note: I have Changed two images as one of them was working well and one image used in mock up was deleted accidently and couldn't found it at pixbay.
Furhtermore, in mock up images in home apge are shown as circle. In this assignment I was unable to make image circle becuase image should be complete square to make in circle in CSS. I tried but it wasn't giving good look so my images are not fully rounded.

Important: I have added my mock-up as pdf in the image folder

SORRY! I tried but somehow my site header is not resposive, I would like to know about it after getting results, just to improve my work. Thanks
