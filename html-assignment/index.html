    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I migrated to Canada in 1997 with my husband Sam. I am mother of two kids; a daughter and a son. I possess a Bachelor's degree in arts from Pakistan. Also, I have graduated in webdesign with Honors from CDI College Mississauga in 2005.<br>
      I recieved multiple full time job offers. Unfortunately, my famil responsibilities did not permit me for the full time job. I take my responsibilities seriously.So, I prefered my family resposibilty over the job.
     </p>
    <p>Furthermore, I commenced on volunteering with some non profit orgnizations.I volunteered for creating their website designs, logo creation, business cards, etc. I also have volunteered with Rogers Tv, Mississauga, & Brampton. There, I performed the duties, of camera operating, graphics, VTR control, audio control and mixing, guest services control, and as a switcher who control the final program broadcasting, both for live and recorded programs. I love helping others, so I volunteered at Toronto Pearson Airport as a welcome team member. On the other hand, I also have done job at Toronto Pearson Airport, as an access control officer. I truly enjoyed my job. In 2016, due to my kids higher education, we moved to ottawa. My kids are bilingual, and for the bilinguals ottawa is the best place. My kids are grown up now, and I have enough time to carry on full time job. That&#39;s	why I have decided to upgrade my studies in webdesign and media according to the current job market. So, I have statred &#34;Iteractive Media Design&#34; program with Algonquin. Stained glass and oil painting, photo & video editting, interior decor, and floral arrangements are my favoutie hobbies. I love creative work, as it keeps me motivated and enthusiastic&#33;</p>
