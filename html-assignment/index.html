    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I migrated to Canada in 1997, with my husband Sam. I am a mother of two kids; a daughter and a son. I possess a Bachelor's degree in arts from Pakistan. Also, I have graduated in Webdesign with Honors from CDI College Mississauga in 2005.<br>
      I received multiple full-time job offers. Unfortunately, my family responsibilities did not permit me for a full-time job. I take my responsibilities seriously. So, I preferred my family responsibility over the job. Although, it was a tough decision<br>
      but, my kids were my priority. It is a moral duty of the parents to provide their children proper care, education, and protection as well.
     </p>
    <p>Furthermore, I commenced volunteering with some non-profit organizations. I volunteered to create their website designs, logo creation, business cards, etc. I have also volunteered with Rogers Tv, Mississauga, & Brampton.<br> 
      There, I performed the duties, of camera operating, graphics, VTR control, audio control and mixing, guest services, and as a switcher. The Switcher is responsible for the final program broadcasting, both for the live and recorded programs. 
      I love helping others, so I volunteered at the Toronto Pearson Airport as a welcome team member. On the other hand, I also have done a job at the Toronto Pearson Airport, as an access control officer. I truly enjoyed my job. In 2016, we moved to ottawa. I could not carry on my job, because that company does not operate in Ottawa. My kids are grown up now, and I have enough time to carry on full time job. That&#39;s	why I have decided to upgrade my studies in webdesign and media according to the current job market. So, I have statred &#34;Iteractive Media Design&#34; program with Algonquin College.<br>
