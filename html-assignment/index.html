    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>I migrated to Canada in 1997 with my husband Sam. I have a Bachelor's degree in arts. 
      I am mother of two kids; a daughter and a son. I upgraded my studies in webdesign from CDI College Mississauga in 2005.
      I recieved multiple full time job offers. Unfortunately, my kids responsibilties did not permit me to work full time. 
      I take my responsibilities seriously.So , I prefered my family resposibilty instead of job.
     </p>
    <p>Furthermore, I commenced on volunteering with some non profit orgnizations.
      I volunteered for creating their website designs, logo creation, business cards, etc. I also have volunteered with Rogers Tv Mississauga & Brampton, and at 
      Toronto Pearson Airport as a welcome team member. In addition, I have done job at Toronto Pearson Airport as an access control officer. I truly enjoyed my job.
      As my kids are grown up now , and I have enough time to carry on full time job. That's why I have decided to upgrade my studies in webdesign and media according 
      to the current job market. So, I have statred &#34;Iteractive Media Design&#34; program with Algonquin. I love creative work, as it keeps me motivated and 
      enthusiastic&#33;</p>
