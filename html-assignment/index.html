    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I migrated to Canada in 1997 with my husband Sam. I have Bachelor's degree in arts from backhome. 
      I am mother of two kids a daughter and a son. I upgraded my studies in webdesign from CDI College Mississauga in 2005. I recieved multiple full time job offers.
      Unfortunately, I was not able to do full time job due to my kids responsibilty. Athough, I was interested in part time job, the employers were not willing for that. I take my 
      resposibilities seriously, so preferred my kids rather than job. In addition, I carried on volunteering with some non profit orgnizations. <br>
      I volunteered for their website designs, logo creation, business cards, etc. I also volunteered with Rogers Tv Mississauga & Brampton.
