    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I migrated to Canada in 1997 with my husband Sam. I am mother of two kids; a daughter and a son. I possess a Bachelor's degree in arts from Pakistan. Also, I have graduated in webdesign with Honors from CDI College Mississauga in 2005.<br>
      I recieved multiple full time job offers. Unfortunately, my famil responsibilities did not permit me for the full time job. I take my responsibilities seriously.So, I prefered my family resposibilty over the job.
     </p>
    <p>Furthermore, I commenced on volunteering with some non profit orgnizations.I volunteered for creating their website designs, logo creation, business cards, etc. I also have volunteered with Rogers Tv, Mississauga, & Brampton. There, I performed the duties, of camera operating, graphics, VTR control, audio control and mixing, guest services control, and as a switcher who control the final program broadcasting, both for live and recorded programs. I love helping others, so I volunteered at Toronto Pearson Airport as a welcome team member. On the other hand, I also have done a job at the Toronto Pearson Airport, as an access control officer. I truly enjoyed my job. In 2016, we moved to ottawa. I could not carry on my job, because that company does not operate in Ottawa. My kids are grown up now, and I have enough time to carry on full time job. That&#39;s	why I have decided to upgrade my studies in webdesign and media according to the current job market. So, I have statred &#34;Iteractive Media Design&#34; program with Algonquin. Stained glass and oil painting, photo & video editting, interior decor, and floral arrangements are my favoutie hobbies. I <em>love creative work</em>, as it keeps me motivated and enthusiastic&#33;</p>
